# Importing datasets


We will use two datasets which are freely available. The [Iris](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) and [Wine Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews) dataset, which we can both load in using pandas `read_csv` method.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
```

```{python}
iris = pd.read_csv('Dataset\iris.csv', names=['sepal_length','sepal_width','petal_length','petal_width','class'])
iris.head()
```

```{python}
wine_reviews = pd.read_csv('Dataset\winemag-data-130k-v2.csv', index_col=0)
wine_reviews.head()
```

# Matplotlib


Matplotlib is the most popular python plotting library. It is a low-level library with a Matlab like interface which offers lots of freedom at the cost of having to write more code. 

To install Matplotlib pip and conda can be used. 

```
pip install matplotlib
or
conda install matplotlib
```

Matplotlib is good for creating basic graphs like line charts, bar charts, histograms and many more. It can be imported by typing:

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

## Scatter plot

To create a scatter plot in Matplotlib we can use the `scatter` method. We will also create a figure and an axis using `plt.subplots` so we can give our plot a title and labels. 

```{python}
# create a figure and axis
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# scatter the sepal_length against the sepal_width
ax.scatter(iris['sepal_length'],iris['sepal_width'])

# set title and labels
ax.set_title('Iris Dataset')
ax.set_xlabel('Sepal Length')
ax.set_ylabel('Sepal Width')
```

We can give the graph more meaning by coloring each point by its class. This can be done by creating a dictionary which maps from class to color and then scattering each point on its own using for-loop and passing respective color. 

```{python}
# create color dictionary
colors = {'Iris-setosa':'r', 'Iris-versicolor':'g', 'Iris-virginica':'b'}

# create figure and axis
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# plot each data point
for i in range(len(iris['sepal_length'])):
    ax.scatter(iris['sepal_length'][i], iris['sepal_width'][i], color=colors[iris['class'][i]])

# set title and labels
ax.set_title('Iris Dataset')
ax.set_xlabel('Sepal Length')
ax.set_ylabel('Sepal Width')
```

## Line chart

In Matplotlib we can create a line chart by calling the `plot` method. We can also plot multiple columns in one graph, by looping through the columns we want and plotting each column on the same axis. 

```{python}
# get columns to plot
columns = iris.columns.drop(['class'])

# create x data
print('Iris shape:', iris.shape)
x_data = range(0, iris.shape[0])

# create figure and axis
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# plot each column
for column in columns:
    ax.plot(x_data, iris[column])

# set title and legend
ax.set_title('Iris Dataset')
ax.legend()
```

## Histogram

In Matplotlib we can create a Histogram using the `hist` method. If we pass it categorical data like the points column from the wine-review dataset it will automatically calculate how often each class occurs

```{python}
# create figure and axis
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# plot histogram
ax.hist(wine_reviews['points'])

# set title and labels
ax.set_title('Wine Review Scores')
ax.set_xlabel('Points')
ax.set_ylabel('Frequency')
```

## Bar chart

A bar chart can be created using `bar` method. The bar chart isn't automatically calculating the frequency of a category so we are going to use pandas `value_counts` function to do this. The bar chart is useful for categorical data that doesn't have a lot of different categories (less than 30) otherwise it gets messy. 

```{python}
# create a figure and axis
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# count the occurrence of each class
data = wine_reviews['points'].value_counts()

# get x and y data
points = data.index
frequency = data.values

# create a bar chart
ax.bar(points, frequency)

# set title and labels
ax.set_title('Wine review scores')
ax.set_xlabel('Points')
ax.set_ylabel('Frequency')
```

# Pandas visualisation

Pandas Visualisation makes it easy to create plots out of a pandas dataframe and series. It also has a higher level API than Matplotlib and therefore we need less code for the same results. 


## Scatter plot

To create a scatter plot in Pandas, we can call `<dataframe>.plot.scatter()` and pass it two arguments, the name of x-column as well as the name of y-column. Optionally, we can also pass it ia title. 

```{python}
iris.plot.scatter(x='sepal_length', y='sepal_width', title='Iris Dataset')
```

As we can see in the graph, it is automatically setting the x and y label to the column names. 


## Line chart
To create line chart in Pandas we can call `<dataframe>.plot.line()`. Whilst in Matplotlib, we needed to loop-through each column we wanted to plot, in Pandas we don't need to do this because it automatically plot all available numeric columns. 

```{python}
iris.drop(['class'], axis=1).plot.line(title='Iris dataset')
```

If we have more than one feature, Pandas automatically creates a legend for us, as can be seen in the image above.


## Histogram
In Pandas, we can create Histogram with the `plot.hist` method. There aren't any required arguments but we can optionally pass some like the bin size. 

```{python}
wine_reviews['points'].plot.hist()
```

It's also easy to plot multiple histograms.

```{python}
iris['sepal_length'].plot.hist(bins=20)
```

```{python}
iris.plot.hist(subplots=True, layout=(2,2), figsize=(10,10), bins=20)
```

The `subplots` argument specifies that we want separate plot for each feature and `layout` specifies the number of plots per row and column.


## Bar chart
To plot a bar chart we use `plot.bar()` method, but before we can call this we need to get the data. For this, we will first count the occurrences using `value_counts()` method and then sort in ascending order using `sort_index()` method.  

```{python}
wine_reviews['points'].value_counts().sort_index().plot.bar()
```

It's also really easy to plot horizontal bar chart using `plot.barh()` method. 

```{python}
wine_reviews['points'].value_counts().sort_index().plot.barh()
```

We can also plot other data then the number of occurrences. 

```{python}
wine_reviews.groupby('country').price.mean().sort_values(ascending=False)[:5].plot.bar()
```

In the example above we grouped the data by country and then took the mean of the wine prices, ordered it, and plotted top 5 countries with the highest average wine price.

```{python}

```
